## Details
Our project can be dvided into following sections 
<ul>
  <li> Data Preprocessing </li>
  <li> Data Visualiztion including bar chart, corrlection graph, box plot and WordCloud </li>
  <li> Predict the “staying power” of a trending video </li> 
      <p> 1. Machine learning model (Linear/Logistic classifcation, Random forest, Extra Tree Regression) <br/>
          2. DNN model </p>
  </ul>
  
## Data Source
 - [US Videos.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new#USvideos.csv)
